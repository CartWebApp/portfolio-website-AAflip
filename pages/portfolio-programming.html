                <li>This was a game created by myself in collaboration with two of my friends</li>
                <li>The name and design was inspired by a website created by our teacher to encourage students to
                    complete their work.</li>
                <li>This website was created with the purpose of helping us improve our technical skills and to create
                    something fun that people would enjoy</li>
                <li>The website functions similar to games like cookie clicker, where in order to buy upgrades you need
                    to click on the screen, and upgrades help you progress even faster.</li>
                <li>There is no story or overarching goal in this game due to us moving on to bigger and better
                    projects, however it still showcases a good level of technical knowledge.</li>
